# HARC-EPBs

**HamSCI Amateur Radio Communications (HARC) for Equatorial Plasma Bubbles Study**

This project develops tools for detecting and analyzing Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) and its related wave structures using HamSCI Amateur Radio data and other space weather dataset. It builds upon earlier work initially coded by a student, Diego Sanchez, under my guidance on EPBs-related part, and is now being actively developed for more complete implementation and research integration by myself.

## Purpose

- Detect EPBs-related features
- Detect large-scale wave structure (LSWS)
- More to come...

## Credits

- **Project Lead & Concept**: Dr. Kornyanat Hozumi
- **Project Supervision**: Dr. Nathaniel A. Frissell
- **Initial Assistance**: A student contributor (Diego Sanchez) assisted with early-stage data preparation and plotting (e.g., HDF5 file handling and initial visualization).  
- **Current Development**: Dr. Kornyanat Hozumi and Diego Sanchez
